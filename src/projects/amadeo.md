Amadeo is a startup that aims to simplify the insurance process for young people. You fill out an interactive questionaire about your life situation and Amadeo uses your data to scrape various insurance partner sites and propose you a tailored, customizable package. The project involved lots of remote scraping via phantomjs, a node.js / mongodb backend as well as a state-of-the-art react powered frontend. Due to legal difficulties the project never went live after the prototype.
