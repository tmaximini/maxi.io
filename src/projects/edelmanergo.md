In November 2015 I was hired by gosub (part of edelman) to built the first version of [https://www.edelmanergo.com](https://www.edelmanergo.com) in a short time frame, because the announcement of the two companies joining was just around the corner. We built a HTML5 single-page application and a complex gsap animation. Since then, the page has been continously updated by the in-house team of edelmanergo.
