## What are traits of good developers?

1. Don't panic - Break down complex problems in smaller work units

They don't start panicking when they face a huge challenge. Instead, they break it down into several sub tasks and create a roadmap in their head, how and in which order to tackle each problem.
Even if they don't know the solutions for each subtask right away (that is rarely the case) they know how to find the necessary answers and where to dig.
Depending on schedule, this involves delegating some of the sub tasks to other team members (think backend, front-end, design, etc).

2. The ability to abstract

some computer science concepts

3. Design complex architectures and systems

comes from experience

4. They know there tools (SCM, IDE, processes, command line, language features)

5. They have a beginners mindset

The tech world is constantly evolving. If you are not actively trying to stay up to date and curious to learn new tools, features, frameworks and keep your eyes open, you might feel left behind quickly. Good developers are usually eager and motivated to stay up to date but as it is impossible to learn everything they also have the ability to filter and judge quickly if something is relevant for their business / career or not.

6. Good communicators and listeners

Developers don't just sit on their desks with headphones and nerd away all the time, they have to actually communicate. There are meetings with project managers, stakeholders, other developers where we discuss timelines, estimations, ideas, features, problems, implementation details. It is important that we are able to express our ideas, visions, problems and so on cohesively with our co-workers. This means explaining our own opinions as well as listen and consider other opinions in order to find the best possible solution for everyone. And because our job is not just technical but involves people and emotions we all should aim for a non violent way of communicating and show empathy and compassion towards others.

7. Good mentors

Everyone started somewhere. Without mentoring there would be very few experienced programmers out there. Most of us will still remember the early days where we knew next to nothing and ...
It is important to be inclusive and to mentor everyone as well as accept mentoring from others (create a shared ownership of the code).
This can be done through pair programming, code reviews, team chat, or in person.
