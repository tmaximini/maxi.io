Aretha Iskandar is a singer, songwriter and cinematic artist from Paris. I met her on my travels to India in 2018. I built her new website using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - my favorite tool for building static sites at the moment, because it leverages the dynamic nature of React.js and adds all the best practices for performance, SEO, accessibility and so on under the hood. The menu animation is a codrops inspired CSS Grid animation. Go check it out on [arethaiskandar.com](https://arethaiskandar.com).
