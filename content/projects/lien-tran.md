The personal website of Berlin based interior architect and designer Lien Tran was one of my first professional projects after I went freelance in 2014.
I used the then famous Angular.js framework and different gulp workflows for the frontend, focusing on a responsive experience for all mobile devices.
We used [keystonejs](http://keystonejs.com/) as a content management system for the backend.
