Since 2019 I support the team around immaker gmbh, who build and operate several e-commerce solutions for clients like 11teamsports, kicker, fca and others.
I helped migrating the microservice architecture to aws, building an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins CI. I also build and maintain various microservices in node.js and help to implement and refactor the react.js based front-end.
