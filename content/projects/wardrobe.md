During my work for fleek I was asked by another team to quickly put together this one-pager as a landing page for their upcoming mobile application. As I am currently very hyped on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) this was my tool of choice for the job as it makes developing static sites fun again using all the modern tools, such as React and styled-components.
